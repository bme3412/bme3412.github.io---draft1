    <h2>Objective/Summary: Using machine learning to contextualize the best of the NBA since 2000</h2>
    <p>I want to find the best players, the best games, and the best teams of the NBA since 2000.</p>
    <p>Figure out ranking of top players by year - need to figure out a methodology for this - quintile the data? What were the best games to watch  -sum game_score by date. Figure out the top 25 players to add to the list of top 75 players. Triple double work.
    </p>
    <h3>Identify test parameters, a question, and have a hypothesis</h3>
    <h4>Hypothesis:</h4>
    <h4>Methodology:</h4>
    <p>I need to rank and quantile/qcut each data point; figure out how to score each factor with reasoning then find the average factor exposure per season.</p>
    <p>The first result of my google search for "Best NBA players since 2000" yielded an interesting result in that it ranked the best player in the league for each year since 2000. This is a great starting point. The informative graphic is reproduced below -- and also provides a good hypotheis with which to use data to prove or disprove, in terms of who was the best player in the league for each year.  </p>

    <h2>But first - how did I get all the data?</h2>
    <br>
    <h4>First, I used an API, web scraping, and Pandas to get all game-logs from each player for each team since the 2000 season</h4>
    <p>Much of my data collection relied on data from the  <span><a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/" target="_blank"> excellent Basketball Reference website,</a></span>  which has compiled statistics for seemingly every NBA game and NBA player that has ever played (and even data on the defunct ABA league). Using a combo of web scraping and calling APIs, for each of the 30 franchises in the NBA, I created a Jupyter workbook that pulled in the game log (an individual player's stats during a game) of each player for each of the 82 games played since 2000. With 12 players per team, 82 games played per year, 30 teams and 20 seasons, this implies a total dataset of ~590,400 records (12*82*30*20), although there is likely statistical noise involved.</p>
    <p>With the API, I used a while loop that pulled in gamelogs for each player for every game of each season since 2000. I organized the data processing with NBA season as the iterator, and saved each gamelog to a dataframe specific for a given season and given team. I then saved the output into csv format for easier data engineering and analysis. I organized my file structure to consist of 30 folders for 30 teams, each containing 21 csv files with dataframes of each player's gamelog for every game of a certain season.</p>
    <figure>

      <img src="/img/bos_csvs.png" srcset=""alt="bos-csv">
      <figcaption>Each team folder holds 21 CSV files holding dataframes of each player's gamelog</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Then for each team, I appended all dataframes into one master dataframe with all game logs for every player since the 2000 season. I then ranked by highest GAME_SCORE to rank the best individual games for each NBA team since 2000. </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="/img/BOS_df.png" srcset=""alt="bos-df">
      <figcaption>Jayson Tatum's 60 point game ranks as the best individual game for the Boston Celtics since the 2000 season</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>I then appended all team dataframes to compile a master dataframe for each game log for each player on each team for each season since since 2000. I also ranked this by GAME_SCORE. </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="/img/NBA_df.png" srcset=""alt="nba-df">
      <figcaption>Kobe Bryant tallied the best individual game of the past 20 years with his scintillating 81 point outburst against Toronto in 2006</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br>
    <h4>I also used web scraping and Pandas to pull in season stats for each player on each team since the 2000 season</h4>
    <p>To rank players by year - need to get each individual game, and quantile all values that matter. Then find a moving average within each season, and then take an average-weight to quantile (histogram) for each season. Then do this for the entire time period, years 2000-2021. </p>
    <h3>Where to store the data for easy access? Enter SQL </h3>
    <p>Now that I have all the data for every game played by every NBA player since the 2000 season, I need a place to store the data. For this I rely upon SQL -- which I use with python for easier data manipulation..</p>
    <h2>How Many Triples Doubles have been recorded since 2000?</h2>
    <p>A 'triple double' in basketball is a statistical occurrence during which a player records >=10 in any three of the offensive statistical measures during a single game. As an example, the most common form of a triple-double is when an individual player tallies 10 or more points, 10 or more rebounds, and 10 or more assists for one game (the name refers to three stat categories in double digits). Some pundits regard it as a sign of basketball excellence, while others regard it as merely an outcome of stat-padding; the true meaning is likely somewhere in between. Triple-doubles historically have been rare, but have increased in prominence with the increased popularity of the three-point shot and increased pace of the game (higher ending game scores are indicative of more offensive possessions). </p>
    <p>Since 2000, there has been a total of 1,090 triple-doubles tallied by NBA players. This includes 1,076 triple-doubles of the point-rebounds-assists variety, with 13 composed of point-rebounds-blocks, and 1 including rebounds, assists and steals. </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="/img/trip_dub_pra.png" srcset=""alt="trip-dub-pra">
      <figcaption>Russell Westbrook is the clear leader among the top 25 players that posted triples-doubles since 2000</figcaption>

    </figure>
    <p>Possibly the most unique stat-line in NBA history (or at least since 2000): on February 10, 2017, Draymond Green of the Golden State Warriors recorded the first triple-double in NBA history without scoring double-digits in points. </p>
    <figure>

    <h2>Once considered a majority-American sport, basketball is played in all parts of the world and the NBA is increasingly globally diverse</h2>
    <p>The 1992 Olympics held in Barcelona, Spain marked the first time that American NBA players participated in the Olympics. And it showed, as the team, featuring Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and Charles Barkley, beat opponents by an average margin of 44 points on their way to taking home the gold medal. But the world has caught up since then, considerably, to the extent that the past 3 players awarded league MVP have been non-American.</p>
    <p>As shown below, international players represented ~23% of NBA rosters for the 2021 season (American players were 77%), which has been a steady mix shift since 2000, when 9 out of 10 players were American. In the 2021 season, American players hailed from 46 different countries, which is more than double the amount of countries represented in the 2000 season.</p>
