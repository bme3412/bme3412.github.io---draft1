    <p>Here's how I became a tech investor:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>I studied abroad in Paris, France in 2009 -- which was a time of tremendous personal growth -- and as the financial crisis hit back home I followed the headlines and the wild moves in the stock market, which sparked curiousity and an interest in learning about investing.</li> <br>

      </figure>
      <li>I then read everything I could about investing - everything from Warren Buffett shareholder letters, to Seth Klarman, and then persistently networked and cold-called my way into a job as a portfolio analyst for a multi-bn $$ AUM large cap core equity strategy.</li>
      <li>During my first job, I wore many hats and the position eventually evolved to the role of junior portfolio manager amongst a team of 3 other portfolio managers and an analyst. I did everything from sizing up trades and sending trades to the traders, running quantitative screens for idea generation, participating in investment discussions with analysts and the PM, and eventually working on my own ideas to pitch to the fund. </li>
      <li>Then, I wanted to conduct more intensive research, so in 2015 I joined a global technology fund. At the time I joined, the strategy AUM was at $500m; it currently is at over $3.5bn and has won several industy awards for outstanding performance.</li>

      <li>Finally, as the COVID-19 pandemic hit, and after learning so much about the ability of technology to create tremendous productivity gains through use cases such as AI and machine learning, I dedicated myself to learning python. I relied on everything from books, to YouTube videos, to meetup groups, as well as online communities such as StackOverflow, and finally learning platforms such as DataCamp and Udemy, to learn the ins and outs of python and its various libraries. Through intensive practice, sincere interest, and grit, I wrote code most days and realized the seemingly untapped power of programming.</li>
      <li>Now - in 2022, I am looking for a job as a data scientist. </li> <br>

    <p>From February to June 2009, I studied abroad in Paris at <a href="https://www.sciencespo.fr/en" target="_blank">Sciences Po,</a> and it changed my life. This was a time of tremendous personal growth for me and I experienced an exponential expansion of my worldview, as I was usually the only American in my classes. It was also a time of great stress back home, with the economy still reeling from the effects of the Global Financial Crisis. Despite having the time of my life while exploring Europe, I couldn't keep my eyes off the headlines back home about the daily moves of the stock market. The much-publicized and often violent moves of the stock market piqued an interest in understanding the economy, the stock market, and basically, as an American in Paris at the time, understanding how the world works.</p><br>
    <br>
   
    

    <p> When I returned home, I read about investing. I read anything I could find - everything from Warren Buffett shareholder letters, to Seth Klarman's 'Margin of Safety', to Ben Graham's 'Security Analysis'. And then, when it came time to find a job, I knew I wanted to start on the buyside, as I felt this was the best way to become a better investor. So I networked extensively, mostly with college alumni, and cold-called anyone I could find that I thought would get me a foot in the door. I met with over 30 people in-person in Boston and New York City for informational interviews, and if including phone conversations and emails, I must have spoken with close to 75 people before getting my first job. This was in 2011; LinkedIn was a few years old, so I used creative searches on the alumni directory website to find people with interesting jobs, all with the goal of picking their brain and learning more about the investment management industry.</p> 

    <p>Finally, my persistence paid off, as my first job out of school was as a portfolio analyst on a multi-$billion AUM large cap equity strategy at a large global asset management firm in Boston. I didn't fully grasp it then, but it was the perfect first job for me and a phenomenal introduction to the industry. I wore many hats during my first job and my responsibilties evolved as I improved as an investor.</p>
    <p>Then, in November 2016, I joined a global technology fund.  A funny thing happened along the way - I became interested in being a technologist. </p>
    <p>And then on the weekends in the summer, you can find me at the beach on Cape Cod.</p>
