    <h2>How many Python files did I create in order to become Pythonic?</h2>
    <h3>Answer: {}</h3>
    <p>Context: The first time it sunk in for me that COVID-19 was more than something trivial was the night of March 11, 2020 and it all occured in a span of about 35 minutes. Obviously I was aware of the virus - rising uncertainty about the contagion had ended the 11-year bull market run, with stocks down over 20% from prior peaks in February. Like any other evening on the 11th, a Wednesday, I was watching baskeball before heading to bed. Shortly after 9:00 PM, actor Tom Hanks took to social media that he and his wife had tested positive for the virus. </p>
    <p>Then, at 9:27 PM, hyper-vigilant NBA reporter and twitter fiend Shams Charania <span><a href="https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1237913057596026881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1237913057596026881%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcsports.com%2Fnorthwest%2Fportland-trail-blazers%2Fnba-suspends-season-indefinitely-after-rudy-gobert-tests-positive-covid-19" target="_blank"> reported </a></span>
    that Utah Jazz player Rudy Gobert had tested positive for the virus. (Earlier in the day, as part of a pre-game media session, Gobert had mocked the at-the-time hyperbole of the virus and touched all open microphones at the podium with his massive hands). Charania followed up minutes later with another <span><a href="https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1237914142033444864?lang=en" target="_blank"> tweet</a></span>, reporting that the NBA season had been indefinitely suspended. The sequence of events - Tom Hanks, Rudy Gobert with the red breaking news banner on ESPN.com, shortly followed by the NBA season suspended, all in a span of 32 minutes and which I followed in real time - sounded alarm bells in my head. </p>
    <p>And then we all stayed home, and in my free time, over countless hours on learning platforms such as udemy and Datacamp; hundreds of videos watched on YouTube; and intensive practice writing code for projects, I learned python.</p>
    <p>Twenty years after 9/11, and 548 days after I began my intensive python learning binge, I was curious to know how much time I had spent using and learning python during the pandemic, and I knew the exact tool to help me do it: python.</p>
    <p>Below is a visualization of all the python files I created and the date the file was created. The two data sets refer to Jupyer Notebook files (".ipynb.") and those created on Visual Studio Code (".py"). The complete code can be accessed at this link <span><a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bme3412/Python/blob/main/Projects/The%20Journey.ipynb" target="_blank"> here</a></span>, but below I have replicated the most important parts of the code. </p>

      </figure>
    <p>So if the question is "how many python files did I create starting on March 12, 2020", then here is my thought process: first, that I have to identify, count, and sum up files created both on Jupyter Notebooks, and Visual Studio Code, and I also want to save the date the file was created to meet the question's parameters. I need to be able to search for all files in all folders and subfolders that end in a defined suffix, and I need to collect all relevant data points and present in tabular format. After assessing the quality of the data and identifying reasons for outliers, I need to visualize and present the data in a conclusive and evident format. Only then can I start to propose answers to questions.
    </p>
    <h3>Initial look at the data set:</h3>
    <p>I start by importing all packages and libraries:</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="/img/import.png" srcset=""alt="import packages">
      <figcaption>Import packages</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>And then I locate the proper file directory:</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="/img/directory.png" srcset=""alt="directory">
      <figcaption>Locate files</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Then I write a function using os and pathlib to iterate over all files and create a list of all files in all subfolders in all directories in the root: </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="/img/function.png" srcset=""alt="function">
      <figcaption>write a function</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Next, I create a dictionary for each specific file type: </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="/img/dictionary.png" srcset=""alt="dictionary">
      <figcaption>Create file type dictionary</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Then I write a function that filters all files and saves as a dataframe: </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="/img/dataframe.png" srcset=""alt="directory">
      <figcaption>Save files to dataframe</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>After running the function and renaming data attributes, I use the '.shape' method. The inital file count across the root directory is 15,475. </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="/img/raw_filedf.png" srcset=""alt="raw file">
      <figcaption>Raw DataFrame</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Then I use the built-in value counts function for a high level view of the files list by date and file type. And I take note of the outliers. Immediately, the 5,449 files created exactly 2 years and 1 hour before my birth stick out as noisy data but requires further analysis. </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="/img/value_counts.png" srcset=""alt="value counts">
      <figcaption>30,000 foot view of the file list, saved as 'raw_df' DataFrame</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h3>A more detailed look at the data, and identifying reasons for outliers:</h3>
    <p>First, I need to differentiate between those files accessed on Jupyer Network from those accessed on Visual Studio Code, as the filepaths are different for each source. I effectively need to split the data into 3 buckets: Python files that end in '.py', which indicates Visual Studio Code; Python files that end in '.ipynb', which indicates the file was created on Jupyter Notebook; and all other system files. Below is code used to reclassify certian file names as either 'Python file' or 'Jupyter Notebook', based on the filepath.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="/img/rename_python_files.png" srcset=""alt="rename-python-files">
      <figcaption>Cleaning up the data set by renaming files types</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Note that we still have the same total # of files as before at ~15,475: </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="/img/renamed-count.png" srcset=""alt="renamed-count">
      <figcaption>Cleaning up the data set</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <p>But now I need to investigate the outliers and whey certain dates have hundreds of files saved to my system. I'll need to further investigate files uploaded on 10/26/1985; 8/26/2018; 9/21/2019; and 8/10/2018, among others. The next step is to subset the raw_df by file type ('Python File') and by the suspect dates: </p>
